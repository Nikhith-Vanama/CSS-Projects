### ðŸŽ¨ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

> CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation of HTML elements on a web page.  

> It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and overall design of websites.  

> CSS works by selecting HTML elements using selectors (like `div`, `.class`, `#id`) and applying styles using properties (like `color`, `margin`, `font-size`, etc.).

> There are three ways to apply CSS: Inline (within the HTML tags), Internal (within a `<style>` tag), and External (via a linked `.css` file).  

> When a web page loads, the browser reads the HTML structure and applies the associated CSS to render the styled page accordingly.
